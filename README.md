# September Review

I had a brief detour into Swift, which was fun, but I realized wasn't practical for me (I'll probably blog about it). But, it's been over a month since I played with Rust, and forgot a lot of it. This is going over the chunk of *The Rust Programming Language* I did to this point, to remember what I learned. 

This will probably incorporate snippets of code I previously used.
